    <p>Hello and welcome to my motivation page. As Confucius' quotes site says:</p>
    <blockquote cite="http://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/authors/c/confucius.html"><p>It does not matter how slowly you go as long as you do not stop.</p></blockquote>
    <p>I also love the concept of positive thinking, and <q cite="http://example.com/affirmationsforpositivethinking">The Need To Eliminate Negative Self Talk</q> (as mentioned in Affirmations for Positive Thinking.)</p>
